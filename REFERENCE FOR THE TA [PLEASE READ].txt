Reference for TA:



We left our testing process to ease your grading, so you can actually do commands to see what is going on every run without debugging and
stuff

Some of the things said in class were incogrouent with the program and what is written and what the output file is testing for
an example is that in the output file sensors are not connected, thus nothing will happen, please feel free to ask clarification on how
we made the following conclusion!

Thank you!
